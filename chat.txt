This code creates a scene setup with camera tracking functionality. Here's what each part does:

## Function Overview
`prepare_scene(frame_count)` sets up a complete 3D scene with lighting, camera, and animation controls.

## Step-by-step breakdown:

1. **`create_floor()`** - Creates a ground plane/floor for the scene

2. **`light_rig_obj, _ = create_light_rig(light_count=3)`** - Creates a lighting setup with 3 lights and returns the light rig object

3. **`bpy.ops.object.empty_add()`** - Creates an empty object (invisible helper) that will serve as the focus point

4. **`animate_360_rotation(Axis.Z, frame_count)`** - Sets up a 360-degree rotation animation around the Z-axis for the specified number of frames

5. **`bpy.ops.object.camera_add()`** - Creates a camera in the scene

6. **`bpy.context.scene.camera = camera_obj`** - Sets this camera as the active render camera

7. **`bpy.ops.object.constraint_add(type="TRACK_TO")`** - Adds a "Track To" constraint to the camera
   - This makes the camera automatically point at a target object

8. **`bpy.context.object.constraints["Track To"].target = focus_empty`** - Sets the empty object as the tracking target

9. **`camera_obj.parent = focus_empty`** - Makes the camera a child of the empty object, so when the empty rotates, the camera orbits around it

## Result
The camera will automatically track and orbit around the focus point (empty object) as it rotates 360 degrees around the Z-axis, creating a smooth circular camera movement around the scene.

This is a common technique for creating turntable-style renders where the camera circles around objects to show them from all angles.
